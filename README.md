- url2markdown

url2markdown lets you download an URL and save it as a Markdown file.
Additionally you can provide a list of tags which will get added to the top of
the file. The main idea behind the script is to download articles and feed them
to an Obsidia.md vault already extended with internal Obsidian links.
